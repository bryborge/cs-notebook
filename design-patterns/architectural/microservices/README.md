# Microservices Pattern

The microservices pattern involves creating multiple applications—or microservices—that can work interdependently.
Although each microservice can be developed and deployed independently, its functionality is interwoven with other
microservices.

A key concept in the microservices pattern is the separate deployment of units. This creates a streamlined delivery
pipeline that allows for easy deployment of microservices and increases application scalability. Another key feature of
this pattern is that it is a distributed architecture, meaning that the structure's components can be fully decoupled
and accessed through remote access protocols such as REST, SOAP, or GraphQL. This distributed nature of the pattern
allows for its high scalability properties.

The microservices architecture uses several design patterns: Aggregator pattern, API gateway design pattern, chain of
responsibility pattern, branch pattern, and asynchronous messaging design pattern. Each approach provides a method to
manipulate data to produce services.

A major advantage of microservices architecture is the independent deployment of each microservice. Engineers can write
and maintain each microservice independent of the others, potentially increasing its functionality and scalability.
Further, because each microservice is small, it is easier to rewrite and update. Microservices architecture is best for
web applications and websites with small components. It is also useful for corporate datacenters that have well-defined
boundaries.

Some challenges for microservices come up around complexity, particularly in the network layer. Furthermore, decoupling
services to work completely independent of each other requires significant architectural expertise.
