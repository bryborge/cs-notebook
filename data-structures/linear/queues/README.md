# Queues

## Summary

A queue data structure is a linear data structure used for storing and managing data in a specific order.  It follows
the principle of "First in, First out" (FIFO), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed
for processing.

```
Dequeue                     Enqueue
  |                           |
  v                           v
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |...| n |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
