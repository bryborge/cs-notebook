# Graphs

## Summary

A graph is a non-linear data structure and consists of vertices (sometimes called 'nodes') and edges. Graphs are often
denoted as `G(V, E)` where `G` is Graph, `V` is vertex, and `E` is edge.

## Components

*   **Vertices:** The fundamental unit in a graph. A vertex can be labelled or not labelled.
*   **Edges:** Connect two vertices in a graph, in any way possible. There are no rules. Edges can also be labelled or
    not labelled.

Here is a visual representation of a graph with `7` vertices (A - G) and `8` edges.
