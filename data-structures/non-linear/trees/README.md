# Trees

## Summary

A tree is a non-linear and hierarchical data structure with elements (nodes) arranged in a way that looks like a tree.
The top-most node is called the "root node."  Each node contains data and that data can be of any type.  Nodes are
connected with one another via edges.

## Components

*   **Nodes:** The fundamental unit in a tree.  Contains data of any type.
*   **Edges:** Connect two nodes in a tree.
